mumble-web is an HTML5 Mumble client for use in modern browsers.
The Mumble protocol uses TCP for control and UDP for voice. Running in a browser, both are unavailable to this client. Instead Websockets are used for control and WebRTC is used for voice (using Websockets as fallback if the server does not support WebRTC).
